This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Tech Challenges

1. Checkout a new `branch` of the Repository with your name
2. Separate both challenges with at least a `commit` after each completing challenge 1 or create multiple branches prefixed with your name.
3. At the end of the Challenge. Create a new `Pull Request` to the develop branch and assign a reviewer.


## Dev Challenge 1
(20min cap)

Checkout the html in `/challenge-1/design-elements.html` The code is working but its in a terrible state. See if you can go through the code and fix it.


## Dev Challenge 2
(45min cap)

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Spend at least 5-10 minutes planning out the UI `state` required for the challenge.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- [ ] Add new todos to the list
- [ ] Mark todos as complete
- [ ] Delete todos from the list
- [ ] Filter by all/active/complete todos
- [ ] Clear all completed todos
- [ ] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


#### Next.js Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
